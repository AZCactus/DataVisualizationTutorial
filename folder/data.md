## Code Visualization

**Basics of D3**

Learn the [Basics of D3](https://github.com/zachpino/realtimespace/tree/master/week5). We will learn how to draw some dots with a static dataset to make a simple data visualization.

**Updating Map**

After learning how to pull API, draw map, and use D3, it's time for us to do an exercise to make an [Updating Map](https://github.com/zachpino/realtimespace/tree/master/week6) to combine all the skills togather.

**Transitions**

Motion is important for real-time data visualization. So we should learn how to make [Transitions](https://github.com/zachpino/realtimespace/tree/master/week8) of data points to show change of real-time data, which relates to **Dynamic Nature of Spatial Dimension** in section [Sketch Ideas](sketch.md).

**D3 Examples**

We don't always need to make our own codes totally from scratch, because there are already lots of exsiting online resources which we can use. So learning how to modify and combine existing codes can be an essential skill.
