## Sketch Ideas

**Knowing Data Types**

Data variables and data scales: ways to conceptualize and organize data, informs designers how to visually encode data.

Qualitative
- Nominal:Discrete subdivisions, categories, groupings. *e.g. produce, types of animals*
- Ordinal: Ordered, sequential categories. *e.g.Low Medium High; Past Present Future*
- Dichotomous: Nominal but two categories. Boolean, binary. *e.g. Gender*

Quantitative
- Continuous: Numerical data that can theoretically be measured in infinitely small units.
- Discrete: Consists of numerical values or counts.
- Ratio: Numbers can be compared as multiples of one another. Parts of a whole, proportion, parametric.
- Interval: Individual, sequential numerical ranges. Scale with fixed and defined interval.

Considerations to visually encode these data types effectively

|data type|what’s important|visual perceptual criteria|
| :-------------: | :-------------: | :-----: |
|nominal|make categories distinguishable|clear differentiation, high contrast/separation|
|ordinal|show sequenced ranges|progressive steps or order|
|continuous|show seamless, clear measurements|continuity, clear measurements units|
|discrete|individual counts|distinguishable units|
|ratio|parts of a whole, proportion|distinguishable parts, adding up to a complete unit|

**Dynamic Nature of Spatial Dimension**

Dynamic in two ways: changing existing values and changing the number of visual elements (adding or deleting)

- Fixed: The spatial dimensions do not change. The number of visual elements is fixed at the start of the visualization. Visual elements do not move.
- Create: New elements may be created in response to incoming data. Existing element positions may be mutated.
- Mutable: The number of elements remains fixed throughout the visualization process, but the location of elements may change over time.
- Create & Delete: Elements may be created or deleted in response to incoming data.
