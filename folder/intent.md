The topic I want to focus is ocean fishery and ocean health.

The existing dataset online is messy and I want to sort the vessel information by country, so viewers can focus on countries they are interested in instead of struggling with making sense of the whole dataset. Also I want audiences to explore the correlation between fishery and ocean health, such as endanger species or overfishing. I want to encourage audiences to pay more attention to the topic and supervise illegal fishing activities.

To accomplish this goal, I will first sort the vessel activity information online by countries. Then I will add another layer of data (endangered species, main edible fish distribution, restricted use areas) to the vessel activity data, so that audiences can find some trends and hopefully causality to make them more informed.
