###Intent Statement
---
The topic for visualization spring 2017 at IIT Institute of Design is spatial 'real-time' data. We’re looking for interesting data about a place, where the characteristics of that location are recorded and updated at regular intervals over time. An example would be data gathered through Chicago’s Array of Things that tells you about the nature of a location—e.g. sound, air quality, light at an intersection that’s been outfitted with a sensor node.

Before we begin visualizing data, it is important that we find published sources for our realtime data, which are called **datasets**. A dataset is a collection of data that contains observed elements (called keys or members) and information about those elements (called values, data points, or parameters). You are probably most familiar with Excel's presentation of datasets which represent keys as rows, and values as columns. Datasets, however, come in many other forms -- comma-separated-value files, HTML tables, JSON arrays, Javascript API's, network matrices, RSS feeds, and many other exotic formats.

**The topic I want to focus is ocean fishery and ocean health.**

The existing dataset online is messy and I want to sort the vessel information by country, so viewers can focus on countries they are interested in instead of struggling with making sense of the whole dataset. Also I want audiences to explore the correlation between fishery and ocean health, such as endanger species or overfishing. I want to encourage audiences to pay more attention to the topic and supervise illegal fishing activities.

To accomplish this goal, I will first sort the vessel activity information online by countries. Then I will add another layer of data (endangered species, main edible fish distribution, restricted use areas) to the vessel activity data, so that audiences can find some trends and hopefully causality to make them more informed.
