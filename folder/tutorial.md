## Make Tutorial

Sharing is always fun. Particularly when the field of data visualization is still in its early stage and the community is still small. Every tutorial can be not only a valuable resource for other people to refer to, but also a building block for the whole field to build upon. 

Also, [GitHub](https://github.com) is very easy to use by referring to the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links).

Furthermore, there are some commuities (e.g. [Core77](http://www.core77.com/), [Parsons Journal for Information Mapping](http://piim.newschool.edu/journal/issues/), [Information Visualization](http://journals.sagepub.com/home/ivi)) which are working on generating new knowledge of this field. Don't feel lonely and connect with more professionals and enthusiasts to push the field to a new level!
