# DataVisualizationTutorial
Our world is increasingly being scanned, sensed, and logged into datasets by governments, organizations, and individuals. Scientists, sociologists, and technologists are tracking biometric, environmental, and sociopolitical data with ever greater comprehensiveness, precision, and frequency — indexed by latitude and longitude coordinates. Increasingly, that spatial data is being made available in real time — allowing communication designers to produce data visualizations that serve as archives of the past, and simultaneously constantly-updated reflections of the present. The visualization of this real time information offers designers and viewers the opportunity to track changing variables, identify trends, and discover unexpected transient insights. Here I wull introduce how I created my viz, accessed API, etc by taking Zach’s weekly tutorials as reference.
